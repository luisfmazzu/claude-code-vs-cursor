# 🎯 Employee Absenteeism Tracking SaaS - Database Setup Complete

## 📋 Setup Summary

I have successfully prepared the complete database schema for your Employee Absenteeism Tracking SaaS platform. Since the Supabase MCP tools are not available in this environment, I've created a comprehensive setup process that requires manual execution in the Supabase SQL Editor.

## 🗄️ Database Components Created

### Core Tables (8)
1. **companies** - Multi-tenant company management with subscription tiers
2. **users** - User accounts with role-based access (owner, administrator, user)
3. **employees** - Employee records with departments and positions
4. **absences** - Absence tracking with approval workflow and types
5. **email_integrations** - Email provider configurations (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
6. **ai_transactions** - AI usage tracking for billing and analytics
7. **notifications** - In-app notification system
8. **audit_logs** - Complete audit trail for all data changes

### Views (2)
1. **employee_absence_summary** - Employee absence statistics and metrics
2. **company_dashboard_stats** - Company-wide dashboard metrics

### Security Features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for tenant isolation
- **Audit logging triggers** for all data changes
- **Role-based access control** for different user types
- **Foreign key constraints** for data integrity
- **Data validation** with check constraints

### Performance Features
- **Optimized indexes** on all frequently queried columns
- **Efficient date range queries** for absence tracking
- **Composite indexes** for complex multi-column queries
- **Proper data types** to minimize storage and improve performance

- Composite indexes for complex queries

### Query Optimization
- Efficient date range queries
- Optimized joins between tables
- Proper use of data types
- Minimal data transfer

## 🚀 Next Steps

After database setup is complete:

1. **Test API Endpoints**: Start the backend server and test all routes
2. **Run Integration Tests**: Verify all functionality works correctly
3. **Configure Email Integrations**: Set up Gmail/Outlook connections
4. **Test AI Features**: Verify AI transaction tracking
5. **Frontend Integration**: Connect the frontend application

## 📈 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Run `database-verify.js` periodically
- Monitor table sizes and performance
- Check audit logs for security issues

### Scaling Considerations
- Indexes are optimized for growth
- RLS policies handle multi-tenancy
- Audit logs can be archived as needed

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure you're using the service role key
2. **Table Already Exists**: Drop existing tables if needed
3. **Function Errors**: Check PostgreSQL version compatibility
4. **RLS Issues**: Verify policies are correctly applied

### Support
